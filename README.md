Haskell Hangman
-------------------

A simple Haskell hangman game that runs in your console.

#### Installation

TODO Installation directly from Hackage as executable

#### Getting started

This project is [cabalized][1] so the recommended way to build
it is to use [cabal-dev][2]:

```
cd <<checkout-directory>>
cabal-dev install
```

This will download dependencies, configure, build and install the
hangman program in a local directory called `cabal-dev`.

You can then run the game by executing `./cabal-dev/bin/hangman`.

##### Testing

There are no tests in this project currently.

#### Motivation

I wrote this hangman game within 2 hours while I was bored out of my wits
revising for exams.

What a relief it was! The comfort and fun I get from writing Haskell programs
is indescribable.
